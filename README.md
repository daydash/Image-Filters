# Image-Filters
This is the basic frontend project build on HTML, CSS ans JavaScript.
Project is about the changing the colors of every pixel of the image (uploaded by the user). So ultimately changing the color of image completely by clicking on the different filters.
You can try this ouy by just downloading the .html, .css and .js files in the same directory in your system.

# Presentation (.pptx)
I have also uploaded a .pptx file I used to present this project as my IT training project in my 3rd semester of engineering.
This file will also help you out how the files and the code is actually working
